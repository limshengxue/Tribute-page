                            <p>Warren Buffett may have been born with business in his blood. He purchased his first
                                stock when he was
                                11 years old and worked in his family’s grocery store in Omaha. His father, Howard
                                Buffett, owned a
                                small brokerage, and Warren would spend his days watching what investors were doing and
                                listening to
                                what they said. </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="carousel-item">
                            <img src="Images/certificate.svg" class="d-block conImg" alt="certificate">
                            <p> As a teenager, he took odd jobs, from washing cars to delivering newspapers, using his
                                savings to purchase several pinball machines that he placed in local businesses. His
                                entrepreneurial
                                successes as a youth did not immediately translate into a desire to attend college. His
                                father pressed
                                him to continue his education, with Buffett reluctantly agreeing to attend the
                                University of
                                Pennsylvania. He then transferred to the University of Nebraska, where he graduated with
                                a degree in
                                business in three years.</p>

                            <p> After being rejected by the Harvard Business School, he enrolled in graduate
                                studies at Columbia Business School. While there, he studied under Benjamin Graham – who
                                became a
                                lifelong friend – and David Dodd, both well-known securities analysts. It was through
                                Graham's class in
                                securities analysis that Buffett learned the fundamentals of value investing.</p>

                                <h5 class="card-title">Assess the risk involved</h5>
                                <p class="card-text">Think about the worst and best possible scenarios and promptly make
                                    the most rational, progressive decision. That’s basically the advice Buffett gave his
                                    son, Howie, when the FBI accused the younger Buffett of price-fixing in 1995. Howie
                                    quickly realized that the risks of staying in his then troubled company far
                                    outweighed any potential gains, and so he quit the next day. Assessing risks
                                    carefully helps you see where you are struggling and can guide you to make smarter
                                    decisions</p>

                                <p class="card-text">Warren Buffett is well-known for being frugal and encouraging
                                    others to do so. He’s lived in the same house he bought when he was 28 for a mere
                                    $31,500 to date. Being frugal and conservative with your spending helps you avoid
                                    waste. And when you avoid waste, you make your money work for you and save enough to
                                    invest for the future.</p>

                                <h5 class="card-title">Judge yourself by your own standards</h5>
                                <p class="card-text">Don’t base your decisions, successes or even happiness on what
                                    others say or do. Buffett notes: “You don’t have to swing at everything—you can wait
                                    for your pitch. The problem when you’re a money manager is that your fans keep
                                    yelling, ‘Swing, you bum!'” Instead of following the crowd, measure yourself by your
                                    “Inner Scorecard”—your own standards and not the world’s.</p>
